BrainScan: Alzheimer's Detection with SVM

BrainScan utilizes a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to classify brain MRI images into different stages of Alzheimer's disease, including normal (CN), mild cognitive impairment (MCI and EMCI), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The model is designed to preprocess MRI images, standardize them, and then employ an SVM classifier for accurate stage prediction. The SVM model is optimized through techniques like grid search and cross-validation to achieve high accuracy.

After rigorous training and testing, the SVM model achieved a commendable accuracy, demonstrating its capability in aiding early diagnosis of Alzheimer's. This project underscores the potential of machine learning in medical imaging and diagnostics.
